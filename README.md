An auto dismount/unshapeshift addon which will try to dismount/unshapeshift/stand you and cast the spell in one key press. This addon is incomplete and the one-press functionality is not reasonably possible to support for cases. This addon does include a two-press auto dismounter as a backup, which **DOES** work in all cases.

## Known limitations:
Dismounting (I don't have a mount yet I can test with). Only autostand and autounshapeshift are currently implemented
Bag items (This is simply impossible without writing a custom bag addon, as far as I know).
Mouse-clicking action buttons for non-vanilla-ui bars (bar addons aren't supported, although they could be in the future. Keybinds should still work for most bar addons, however.).
An addon like OPie most likely wouldn't work at all with this addon, without custom support.
